Quick reference: the live delta vs. stock is `git diff main...luma/main`.

## Carried patches

### `patch/mari-unsandboxed-shell`

- **What:** Adds the opt-in env var `MARINARA_MARI_ALLOW_UNSANDBOXED_SHELL` (default `false`) so Professor Mari's `bash` tool can run on platforms with no OS sandbox — notably Android/Termux, which has neither macOS Seatbelt nor Linux bubblewrap, so `bash` otherwise fails closed. The flag only takes effect when no sandbox backend exists (it never downgrades an available Seatbelt/bubblewrap sandbox), and env secrets are still stripped from the child process; only network-deny and workspace-write confinement are dropped. Also makes Mari's sandbox system-prompt line reflect the live status (sandboxed / disabled / unsandboxed).
- **Why forked:** Upstream declined the change as a product decision. Kept locally for single-user, on-device Termux use.
- **Upstream status:** Declined / not merged.
- **Touches:** `packages/server/src/config/runtime-config.ts`, `packages/server/src/services/professor-mari/workspace-shell-sandbox.ts`, `packages/server/src/services/professor-mari/workspace-agent.service.ts`, `packages/shared/src/types/professor-mari-workspace.ts`, `scripts/regressions/professor-mari-shell-sandbox.regression.ts`, `.env.example`, `docs/CONFIGURATION.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.
